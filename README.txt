## Private Blockchain Implementation with JavaScript, Redis, Node.js, and Express.js

This project presents a robust private blockchain implementation using JavaScript, Redis server, Node.js, and express.js. The purpose of this blockchain is to provide a secure and decentralized ledger for recording transactions in a private network.

### Key Features

- **Genesis Block**: The blockchain starts with a well-defined genesis block, which serves as the initial point of the chain.

- **Efficient Mining Functionality**: The mining process is optimized through peer-to-peer (P2P) communication, enabling nodes to collaborate and validate new blocks efficiently.

- **Secure Block Addition**: Each block is securely added to the blockchain by undergoing a thorough hash verification using the Sha256 algorithm.

- **Comprehensive Blockchain Validation**: The entire blockchain is subjected to comprehensive validation to ensure its integrity and consistency, preventing any unauthorized modifications.

- **Nonce Functionality**: Nonce functionality is incorporated to add an additional layer of security and prevent tampering or manipulation of blocks.

- **Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment**: The difficulty level for mining new blocks is adjusted dynamically in bits, similar to the Bitcoin protocol, ensuring optimal mining performance.

- **Adaptive Difficulty Modification**: The difficulty level is adjusted based on the time taken to mine a block, ensuring a consistent block generation rate.

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure Redis server:
   - Install Redis: [Redis Quick Start Guide](https://redis.io/topics/quickstart)
   - Update Redis connection details in `config.js`.

4. Start the blockchain node:
   ```shell
   node app.js
   ```

### Usage

- Use appropriate API endpoints to interact with the blockchain, such as:
  - `/mineBlock` - Mine a new block.
  - `/getBlockchain` - Get the full blockchain.
  - `/getBlock/:blockHash` - Get a specific block using its hash.
  - `/addTransaction` - Add a new transaction to the blockchain.
